One way to get that 9-minute “monster” down into mere seconds is to stop asking one giant LLM call to write every single paragraph at once, and instead split it up into small, parallel jobs—one per section. Each of those calls will be measured in 2–5 s instead of 30–60 s, and if you fire 4–5 of them in parallel you can finish your entire draft in under 10 s.

Below is a complete JSON snippet you can drop into your Replit config to swap your single `generateInitialDraft` agent for seven independent “section generators,” then run them in parallel:

```json

  "pipelineName": "CoverLetterGenerationFlow",

    ]

      "apiKeyEnvVar": "OPENAI_API_KEY",
      "promptTemplate": "Write a closing paragraph that restates enthusiasm, mentions availability, and invites next steps."
    }
  },
  "formatter": {

  }
}
```

### Why this helps

* **Seven tiny calls** instead of one huge one
* **ParallelExecution** fires them all at once (up to 5 in flight)
* Each section is short (2–5 s), so the entire draft happens in \~5–8 s
* You keep `docxtemplater` for sub-second formatting at the end

Give this a shot—and you’ll go from multi-minute runs down to single-digit seconds for a full, high-quality cover letter.
