It looks like even though your download path is working, nothing ever makes its way into the `.docx` buffer. Let‚Äôs instrument and fix your `createDocxFromContent` so you can see exactly what‚Äôs happening‚Äîand ensure you actually build out paragraphs before calling the docx packer.

---

### 1. Add debug logging of the buffer length

In **`server/documentProcessor.ts`**, around your doc‚Äêgeneration function, sprinkle in a console log so you can confirm whether anything‚Äôs in the buffer:

```ts
import { Document, Packer, Paragraph } from "docx";

export async function createDocxFromContent(content: string): Promise<Buffer> {
  const doc = new Document();

  // Split on double‚Äênewline to get paragraphs
  const paragraphs = content.split(/\n{2,}/g).filter(p => p.trim());
  paragraphs.forEach(text => {
    doc.addSection({
      children: [ new Paragraph(text) ]
    });
  });

  // Now pack it
  const buffer = await Packer.toBuffer(doc);

  // üõ†Ô∏è DEBUG: log buffer size
  console.log("üìÑ createDocxFromContent: generated buffer size =", buffer.length);

  return buffer;
}
```

* If you see `buffer.length === 0` in your logs, that means `paragraphs` was empty‚Äîi.e. `content` was blank when it reached here.
* If `paragraphs` is non-empty but the buffer is still zero, something‚Äôs off with the docx build itself.

---

### 2. Verify the incoming ‚Äúcontent‚Äù isn‚Äôt empty

Right before you call `createDocxFromContent`, log the raw string you‚Äôre passing in:

```ts
// In your download route, just before generate:
console.log("üñãÔ∏è CoverLetter content:", JSON.stringify(coverLetterContent).slice(0,200), "‚Ä¶");
const buffer = await createDocxFromContent(coverLetterContent);
```

* If this prints an empty string (`""`) or only whitespace, then the issue is upstream‚Äîyour pipeline never populated `coverLetterContent`.
* If it prints actual text, but you still get a zero-byte buffer, the problem is in the docx packer step.

---

### 3. Ensure you‚Äôre *awaiting* Packer.toBuffer

Double-check you have `await Packer.toBuffer(doc)` (and that your function is `async`). Forgetting the `await` will return a pending Promise instead of a Buffer.

---

### 4. Test locally and watch the logs

1. Trigger cover letter generation for #6 or #8.

2. Observe your console logs for:

   * ‚ÄúCoverLetter content:‚Äù (should show your letter text)
   * ‚Äúgenerated buffer size =‚Äù (should be >1,000 bytes for a multi-paragraph letter)

3. If both look good but you still get a blank download, confirm your Express route is doing:

   ```ts
   res.set({
     "Content-Type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document",
     "Content-Disposition": `attachment; filename="cover_letter_${id}.docx"`,
   });
   res.send(buffer);
   ```

---

Once you see a non-zero buffer in your logs, the download will contain a valid `.docx`. If you still see `0`, the problem is content is blank or Packer isn‚Äôt seeing any paragraphs‚Äîtrace backward to find where the pipeline‚Äôs final draft JSON is being converted into that `coverLetterContent` string.
