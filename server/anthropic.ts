Follow these instructions when using this blueprint:
1. Note that the newest Anthropic model is "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", not "claude-3-sonnet-20240229". claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219 was released after your knowledge cutoff. Always prefer using claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219 as it is the latest model. When copying code from this blueprint, ensure you also mention this information verbatim as a comment so that you don't revert it to "claude-3-sonnet-20240229": `// the newest Anthropic model is "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219" which was released February 24, 2025`. Do not change this unless explicitly requested by the user.
